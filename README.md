# Project Title: FocusFlow
### nwPlus HackCamp 2023 project

## **Project Description:**
With accessebility, diversity and inclusivity in mind. We thought of creating a chrome extention for debatably the most used browser out there. 
This extension is aimed at helping users with ADHD to better focus when reading webpages. By creating an overlay, using bionic font and the ability to highlight lines,
it allows users to beter focus on whatever webpage they are reading.

This is a front project that was made using Chrome API, Webkit tools, JS, HTML & CSS.

## **How To Run Our Program:**

1. enable dev mode in chrome://extensions
2. load unpacked extension
